# Direct-Mapped-Cache
I designed a direct mapped cache of size 64kilobytes with block size: 4 bytes.

Assumed a 32 bit address and figured out how many cache lines are needed.

Output:Reported hit/miss rates of the cache for the input memory
trace files (5 traces) provided.
For reporting hit/miss, I have checked for a tag match, and a valid
bit
